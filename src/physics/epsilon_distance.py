Explicit and Verbose Documentation for the Derivation and Verification of Intrinsic Epsilon Curvature (I_ε)

This script explicitly calculates the gravitational deflection angles for massive astronomical objects, incorporating an epsilon correction term to account for gravitational phenomena not accurately predicted by classical General Relativity (GR). It then precisely derives the intrinsic epsilon field curvature (I_ε) directly from *raw observed* gravitational lensing measurements — before any epsilon correction is applied. This ensures accurate alignment of theoretical predictions with actual astronomical observations.

1. Fundamental Concept:
   - The intrinsic epsilon curvature (I_ε) is the fundamental constant representing equilibrium between gravitational inward collapse and quantum-scale outward oscillatory expansion.
   - The calculation relies on observational data of gravitational arcs, measured visually, and their relationship to fundamental universal constants.

2. Explicit Mathematical Formulas:

   Epsilon-Corrected Deflection Angle (θ_ε):
   θ_ε = (4GM / r c²) × [1 + ε × (1 - 2 × |ε - ⌊ε⌋ - 0.5|)] + [4 × I_ε × ε × (1 - 2 × |ε - ⌊ε⌋ - 0.5|) / c²]

   Rearranged explicitly to solve for Intrinsic Epsilon Curvature (I_ε):
   I_ε = { [θ_observed × c² - (4GM / r)(1 + ε × collapse_factor)] / (4ε × collapse_factor) }

3. Constants and Their Exact Representations:
   - G: Gravitational constant (exactly 6.67430 × 10⁻¹¹ m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻²)
   - c: Speed of light in vacuum (exactly 299,792,458 m/s)
   - solar_mass: Mass of the Sun (exactly 1.98847 × 10³⁰ kg)

4. Important Note:
   ⚠️ The deflection angle used for deriving I_ε must be the raw *observed* deflection — **not** one already corrected with epsilon. This avoids recursive inflation of the intrinsic curvature.

5. Detailed SymPy Implementation:
   - SymPy is explicitly chosen to ensure exact numerical precision by representing constants symbolically rather than as floating-point approximations.
